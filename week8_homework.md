                                        How to do a good job in software quality assurance


- Software quality runs through the software life cycle is a very important problem, is ultimately used in the process of software development technology and verification method. Therefore, in the software life cycle should pay special attention to quality assurance, to produce high quality software product.
    
- Software quality assurance goals is to develop acceptable software products. Here the so-called "acceptable" should be the user to understand the sense of acceptance, or should meet the quality requirements set by a user. So the software quality assurance tasks naturally is to ensure software quality.

- Software quality assurance is to improve prevention, and improvement of inspection to ensure software quality, software life cycle management and to verify that the software is to meet the specified quality and user's demand.

- Software quality assurance is composed of various tasks, these tasks participants are two kinds of people: software developers and software quality assurance personnel. The former is responsible for the technical work, which is responsible for the quality assurance plan, monitoring, recording, analysis and report. Software developers by adopting the method and technical reviews, formal, execution plan software testing careful to ensure the quality of software products. Software quality assurance, the final product is software development group of the quality. So the software developers and software quality assurance personnel is an important part of software quality assurance.

- If the production of a software product is analogous to a factory. The production line is the process, the product in accordance with the provisions of the production line process for production. Software quality assurance system (SQA) responsibility is to ensure that the implementation of the process, which is to guarantee the normal operation of production line.

- So we can conclude that the software quality assurance system (SQA) is responsible for the following three points:

(1) to provide the correct information to the managers, in order to make the software executed correctly;

(2) the collection of quality data, identify and manage risks, promote and assist in process improvement;

(3) as the test supervisor, testing is in accordance with established procedures (test plan, test case, test execution) of.

- The main content includes: software quality assurance of security system, promote process improvement, guiding the implementation of the project, project activities, audit work products, help to solve problems, to provide decision-making reference and the prevention of defects.

- At present, our software quality assurance system is be, sometimes even chaotic, almost no defined process rules and procedures. Software Assurance work depend entirely on the personal efforts and outstanding professionals, depending on the superior management and outstanding effective software developer. The ability of specific performance and results are derived from or depends on the individual and their previous experience, knowledge and their initiative and enthusiasm. Once the software quality crisis will abandon the original plan process, repeated coding and testing. This is very dangerous, directly hindered the effective software quality assurance. In order to guarantee the quality of software, we need organized software quality assurance.

- The software quality assurance process science includes the following activities:

(1) first of all, the establishment of SQA group;

(2) Secondly, select and determine the SQA activity, quality of SQA group for assurance activities, these activities of SQA as SQA input into a plan;

(3) and then, develop and maintain SQA plan, this plan to clear the relationship between the various stages of the SQA activity and the whole of the software development life cycle;

(4) the implementation of the SQA program, training, the relevant personnel to choose quality compatible with the software engineering environment assurance tools;

(5) finally, constantly improve the quality assurance problems existing in the project, improve the quality assurance process.
